# Description
This project consists of a basic website for up-to-date rankings of different sports and tournaments, in particular the ATP and WTA in tennis, and La Liga, Premier League and Ekstraklasa in football.

We used html, css and javascript and also integrated both the front-end framework Bootstrap and the consumption of several external APIs. To deploy it locally, we used the simple http server from Python.

Python must be installed; version 3.7 was used during development.
To run the project, you must go to the project folder, open a terminal window there and type the following command:
- Windows:
_python -m http.server_

Project will now be displayed on: http://localhost:8000/
